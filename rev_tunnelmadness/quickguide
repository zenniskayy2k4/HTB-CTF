2 key functions: get_cell and prompt_and_update_pos

get_cell reveals some information: 
- the maze is organized in a 20 x 20 x 20 cube format, with each cell being 16 bytes
- data for maze is at 001020e0

prompt_and_update_pos tells the general movement guide and restrictions to moving. Mainly, you cant exit the cube's dimensions and certain cells are not accessible. 

Line 17 of the main function is also an important clue to solving the maze.
